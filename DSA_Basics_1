1. What is data-structure?
 Data structure is a way of defining, storing & retrieving of data in a structural & systematic way. A data structure may contain different type of data items.
 
2. What are various data-structures available?
Data structure availability may vary by programming languages. Commonly available data structures are list, arrays, stack, queues, graph, tree etc.

3. What is algorithm?
Algorithm is a step by step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in certain order to get the desired output.

4. Why we need to do algorithm analysis?
A problem can be solved in more than one ways. So, many solution algorithms can be derived for a given problem. 
We analyze available algorithms to find and implement the best suitable algorithm

5. What are the criteria of algorithm analysis?
An algorithm are generally analyzed on two factors − time and space. That is, how much execution time and how much extra space required by the algorithm.

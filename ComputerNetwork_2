1. What are nodes and links?
ANSWER:
Node: Any communicating device in a network is called a Node. Node is the point of intersection in a network. It can send/receive data and information within a network. 
Examples of the node can be computers, laptops, printers, servers, modems, etc.

Link: A link or edge refers to the connectivity between two nodes in the network. It includes the type of connectivity (wired or wireless) between the nodes 
and protocols used for one node to be able to communicate with the other.


2. What is the network topology?
ANSWER:
Network topology is a physical layout of the network, connecting the different nodes using the links. 
It depicts the connectivity between the computers, devices, cables, etc.


3. Define different types of network topology
ANSWER:
The different types of network topology are given below:
Bus Topology:
All the nodes are connected using the central link known as the bus.
It is useful to connect a smaller number of devices.
If the main cable gets damaged, it will damage the whole network.

Star Topology:
All the nodes are connected to one single node known as the central node.
It is more robust.
If the central node fails the complete network is damaged.
Easy to troubleshoot.
Mainly used in home and office networks.

Ring Topology:
Each node is connected to exactly two nodes forming a ring structure
If one of the nodes are damaged, it will damage the whole network
It is used very rarely as it is expensive and hard to install and manage

Mesh Topology:
Each node is connected to one or many nodes.
It is robust as failure in one link only disconnects that node.
It is rarely used and installation and management are difficult.

Tree Topology:
A combination of star and bus topology also know as an extended bus topology.
All the smaller star networks are connected to a single bus.
If the main bus fails, the whole network is damaged.

Hybrid:
It is a combination of different topologies to form a new topology.
It helps to ignore the drawback of a particular topology and helps to pick the strengths from other.


4. What is an IPv4 address? What are the different classes of IPv4?
ANSWER:
An IP address is a 32-bit dynamic address of a node in the network. An IPv4 address has 4 octets of 8-bit each with each number with a value up to 255.

IPv4 classes are differentiated based on the number of hosts it supports on the network. There are five types of IPv4 classes and are based on the first octet 
of IP addresses which are classified as Class A, B, C, D, or E.

IPv4 Class       	         IPv4 Start Address	           IPv4 End Address	          Usage
A	                            0.0.0.0	                  127.255.255.255	     Used for Large Network
B	                            128.0.0.0	                191.255.255.255	     Used for Medium Size Network
C	                            192.0.0.0	                223.255.255.255	     Used for Local Area Network
D	                            224.0.0.0	                239.255.255.255	     Reserved for Multicasting
E                            	240.0.0.0	                255.255.255.254	     Study and R&D


5. What are Private and Special IP addresses?
ANSWER:
Private Address: For each class, there are specific IPs that are reserved specifically for private use only.
This IP address cannot be used for devices on the Internet as they are non-routable.

Special Address: IP Range from 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.255 are network testing addresses also known as loopback addresses are the special IP address.

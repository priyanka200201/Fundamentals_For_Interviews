QUESTION 2: What is a checkpoint in DBMS?
ANSWER:
The Checkpoint is a type of mechanism where all the previous logs are removed from the system and permanently stored in the storage disk.
Checkpoints are those points to which the database engine can recover after a crash as a specified minimal point from where the transaction log record can be used 
to recover all the committed data up to the point of the crash.


QUESTION 3: When does checkpoint occur in DBMS?
ANSWER:
A checkpoint is like a snapshot of the DBMS state. Using checkpoints,
the DBMS can reduce the amount of work to be done during a restart in the event of subsequent crashes. 
Checkpoints are used for the recovery of the database after the system crash. Checkpoints are used in the log-based recovery system.
When due to a system crash we need to restart the system then at that point we use checkpoints. So that, we don't have to perform the transactions from the very starting.


QUESTION 4: What do you mean by transparent DBMS?

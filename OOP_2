1.  How much memory does a class occupy?
Classes do not consume any memory. They are just a blueprint based on which objects are created.
Now when objects are created, they actually initialize the class members and methods and therefore consume memory.


2. Is it always necessary to create objects from class?
No. An object is necessary to be created if the base class has non-static methods. But if the class has static methods, 
then objects donâ€™t need to be created. You can call the class method directly in this case, using the class name.


3. What is a copy constructor?
Copy Constructor is a type of constructor, whose purpose is to copy an object to another. What it means is that a copy constructor will clone an object and
its values, into another object, is provided that both the objects are of the same class.


4. What is a destructor?
Contrary to constructors, which initialize objects and specify space for them, Destructors are also special methods. But destructors free up the resources and 
memory occupied by an object. Destructors are automatically called when an object is being destroyed. 


5. Are class and structure the same? If not, what's the difference between a class and a structure?
No, class and structure are not the same. Though they appear to be similar, they have differences that make them apart. 
For example, the structure is saved in the stack memory, whereas the class is saved in the heap memory. 
Also, Data Abstraction cannot be achieved with the help of structure, but with class, Abstraction is majorly used.

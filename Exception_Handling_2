1. Is there any order in which catch block should be written?
Answer:
Yes, most specific exception should be written first and then generic one.
For example:
below code will give you compilation error.

public static int exceptionTest()
  {
 
   try{
   File f=new File("/usr/abc.txt");
   }
   catch(Exception e)
   {
 
   }
   catch(IOException e) // Compilation error
   {
 
   }
  }
  
  2. Predict output of below program:
 
public class ExceptionTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
   System.out.println(exceptionTest());
  }
  public static int exceptionTest()
  {
   int i=6;
   try{
    return i;
   }
   catch(Exception e)
   {
    i=10;
 
   }
   finally
   {
    System.out.println("In finally block");
   }
   return i;
  }
}
 
Output:
In finally block

Explanation: 
If you notice we have return statement in try block, so before returning from exceptionTest() method, finally block will be executed. When you have return statement 
in try block, JVM will take note of value of i and this value will be returned by exceptionTest method.


3. What is try-with-resources concept in java? How it differs from an ordinary try statement?
Answer:
According to Java docs, try-with-resources statement is a try statement that declares one or more resources. It ensures that each resource is closed at the end of
the statement.

try-with-resources statement can have catch or finally block similar to ordinary try statement. In a try-with-resources statement, JVM makes sure catch or finally
block is run after the resources declared have been closed.


4. Does catch block rethrow an exception in java?What is the difference between throws and throw in java?

This is one of the most frequently asked interview questions for java developers.
Main differences between throws and throw are :

a. throws keyword is used when writing methods, to declare that the method in question throws the specified (checked) exception.
throw is used when an instruction is to explicitly throw the exception.
b.  throws is used with a method signature while the throw is used inside a method.
Answer:
Yes, catch block can rethrow an exception using throw keyword. It is called re-throwing an exception.

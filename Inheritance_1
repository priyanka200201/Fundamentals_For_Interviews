1. What is Inheritance in Java? 
Answer: Inheritance is an Object oriented feature which allows a class to inherit behavior and data from other class.
For example, a class Car can extend basic feature of Vehicle class by using Inheritance.


2. What are different types of Inheritance supported by Java? 
Answer: Java supports single Inheritance, multi-level inheritance and at some extent multiple inheritances because Java allows a class to only extend another class, 
but an interface in Java can extend multiple inheritances.


3. Why multiple Inheritance is not supported by Java?
Answer: Java is introduced after C++ and Java designer didn't want to take some C++ feature which is confusing and not essential.
They think multiple inheritances is one of them which doesn't justify complexity and confusion it introduces.


4. Why Inheritance is used by Java Programmers? 
Answer: Inheritance is used for code reuse and leveraging Polymorphism by creating a type hierarchy. 
It's better to use Inheritance for type declaration but for code reuse composition is a better option because it's more flexible.


5. How to use Inheritance in Java?
Answer: You can use Inheritance in Java by extending classes and implementing interfaces. 
Java provides two keywords extends and implements to achieve inheritance.
A class which is derived from another class is known as a subclass and an interface which is derived from another interface is called subinterface.

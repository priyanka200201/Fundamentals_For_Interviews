4. What makes a network effective and efficient?
Answer:
There are mainly two criteria which make a network effective and efficient:
Performance: : performance can be measured in many ways like transmit time and response time.
Reliability: reliability is measured by frequency of failure.
Robustness: robustness specifies the quality or condition of being strong and in good condition.
Security: It specifies how to protect data from unauthorized access and viruses.


5. What is bandwidth?
Answer:
Every signal has a limit of upper range frequency and lower range frequency.
The range of limit of network between its upper and lower frequency is called bandwidth.
